## Outline

1. Different approaches to hypothesis testing

I'm going to need someone more theory/math heavy than me. 
    - NSHT
        - fisher
        - nehman-pearson
    - Bayes
    - visual inference
    
    Comparing and contrasting these is going to be gross and I'm not honestly sure how visual inference fits in fundamentally...
    
2. Setting up a hypothesis test - parallel version(s)

3. Collecting the data

4. Evaluating the data

5. General Discussion
